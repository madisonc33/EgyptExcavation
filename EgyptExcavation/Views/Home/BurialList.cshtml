@Model BurialList

<p>
    A paginated list of all the burials with a brief summary of the info.
    The ability to filter the results by the relevant criteria.
    For example, if the full data was included in the database, could you answer questions like:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Did the orientation of the mummies change over time?</li>
    <li>Are mummies with similar hair color buried together?</li>
    <li>Which age or gender is most likely buried with dice?</li>
    <li>What is the average thread count of textile wrapping a mummy at a certain depth?</li>
</ul>

temporary to test what it looks like
<partial name="BurialSummary" />

@*this is what we will use*@
@*@foreach (var b in Model.Burials)
{
    <partial name="BurialSummary" model="b" />
}*@
